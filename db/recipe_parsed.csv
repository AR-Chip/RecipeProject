Vietnamese,Beef Pho,"This South Vietnamese-style pho brings comfort with every sip and slurp. It's a restorative, richly seasoned broth ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and served with a host of crisp, tangy, spicy, sweet, and fragrant garnishes. The version you see here has been adapted slightly from LETT101's original with insights from Allrecipes friend and Vietnamese cookbook author Andrea Nguyen and tested in our Allrecipes test kitchens. We specified the amount of ginger and charred the onion and ginger before adding them to the broth. ""That partially cooks those aromatics and kind of mellows things out,"" says Nguyen. ""It's the backbone of the broth."",This version also calls for beef soup bones rather than beef knuckle, which can be harder to find, and is served with the more traditional hoisin sauce rather than the plum sauce mentioned in the original. Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours. Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.

Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt. Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.

Thai,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),"Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. Sauce
Chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. Chicken
Chef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlic
Sliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppers
This is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. Basil
This recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."",There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves. Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil?,Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."",""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too.

Swedish,Traditional Swedish Pepparkakor,"This pepparkakor recipe produces irresistibly crisp cookies that are full of warm, spicy, and cozy flavor. Pepparkakor (or ""pepper cookies"") are Swedish cookies. Similar to gingersnaps, pepparkakor are thin, crisp, and spicy. They're commonly baked and sold in Scandinavian countries during the holiday season. These are the ingredients you'll need to make this traditional pepparkakor recipe:,· Flour: This pepparkakor recipe starts with all-purpose flour, which gives the cookies structure.
· Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
· Spices: These cozy pepparkakor cookies are spiced with cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom.
· Butter: Two sticks of butter add moisture and richness.
· Sugar: A blend of white and brown sugars gives these cookies a perfectly balanced sweet flavor.
· Egg: A beaten egg adds moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dough together.
· Corn syrup: Dark corn syrup adds even more moisture and sweetness. If you'd like a lighter flavor, opt for light corn syrup. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make pepparkakor cookies at home:,1. Make the dough: Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the butter and sugars, then add the remaining ingredients. Add the dry mix to the wet mix, then chill the dough.
2. Roll and cut the dough: Roll the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters.
3. Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Allow the cookies to cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store at room temperature for up to one week. Unbaked pepparkakor dough will freeze well for up to three months. Wrap the dough ball in a layer of storage wrap then a layer of aluminum foil. When you're ready to bake, allow the dough to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then roll, cut, and bake as directed. Baked pepparkakor can be frozen for up to three months. Place the completely cooled cookies in a zip-top freezer bag. Thaw in the fridge overnight.

Fill the paella pan almost to the top with water, measuring the water as you add it so you can determine the amount of rice to add later. Bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 hour to make a nice broth. Season with a generous amount of salt, just enough saffron for a yellow color, thyme, and rosemary. Stir in half as much rice as the amount of water added to the pan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Rabbit can be very hard to find so you can just use a whole chicken instead. It also may be easier to use boneless chicken but then you don't get any fun extras, like hearts and livers. If you do use the hearts and livers, don't put them in until later as they cook very fast. They will however add a nice flavor to the rest of the dish. To account for personal preferences, the seasonings are intended to be added to taste. Add just enough saffron to make a nice yellow color. Season with thyme and rosemary if desired. The goal is to make a rich-tasting broth that will soak into the rice to make it delicious. Since paella pans come in different sizes, water and rice measurements are left open for modifications as well. I like to use bomba, Valencia, or arboria rice.","1 tablespoon olive oil, ½ (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces, ½ (2 pound) rabbit, cleaned and cut into pieces, 1 head garlic, cloves separated and peeled, 1 medium tomato, finely chopped, 1 (15.5 ounce) can butter beans, ½ (10 ounce) package frozen green peas, ½ (10 ounce) package frozen green beans, 1 teaspoon mild paprika, or to taste, 6 cups water, or as needed,   salt to taste, 1 pinch saffron threads, or to taste, 1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste, 1 pinch dried rosemary, or to taste, 3 cups short-grain white rice, or as needed",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-assets.meredithcorp.io%2F4172519c3e0a8bddcef3ffc57f9e054b%2F1692571007921IMG_0259.jpeg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true,"A traditional paella Valenciana.

Southern Recipes,Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits,"Every baker needs a good buttermilk biscuit recipe in their repertoire. If you don't have a go-to yet, you're in luck! Chef John's take on classic buttermilk biscuits is a favorite in the Allrecipes community. Best of all, it's easy to make with ingredients you probably have on hand. Buttermilk is used in biscuit-making for its acid and fat content. Its acidity works with the leaveners to help the dough rise, producing a taller and fluffier biscuit. Buttermilk also adds a subtle tang. Cream biscuits are made with heavy cream. Cream biscuits are beloved because they're incredibly easy-to-make. But, since cream is much milder than buttermilk, they won't be quite as flavorful (unless you incorporate more spices and seasonings). Also, cream biscuits will likely not rise as high as buttermilk biscuits, especially if the recipe doesn't contain enough leavener. Learn more: Here Are the 5 Biscuit Types Every Baker Should Know How To Make,You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these from-scratch buttermilk biscuits:,Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Cut cold butter slices into the flour mixture with a pastry blender until the dough resembles coarse crumbs. Next, make a well in the center of the dough. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and gently stir until combined. Turn the dough out on a floured surface and pat it into a rectangle. Fold the rectangle in thirds, then turn dough a half turn. Gather any crumbs and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat the process two more times. Roll the dough on the floured surface until it's about ½-inch thick. Use a round biscuit cutter to cut the biscuits. Re-roll the scraps and continue cutting until the dough is gone. Transfer the biscuits to a lined baking sheet. Use your thumb to press an indent into the top of each biscuit. Brush the tops with buttermilk. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown. Not sure what to serve with your buttermilk biscuits?

Southern Recipes,Kickin' Collard Greens,"Southern-style collard greens are savory comfort food with a deliciously zesty kick. This classic, down-home side dish features fresh chopped collard greens cooked with crumbled bacon and chicken broth for a perfectly tender finish. Learn how to make this tantalizingly spicy Southern recipe and bring the meat and three right to your door. Plus, get the best methods for storing and freezing. Simple pantry ingredients and affordable produce come together to make this treasured dish. Bacon, garlic, and onion create the flavor base, while chicken broth acts as the braising liquid. Red pepper flakes add a fiery element that you can dial up or down based on preference. Since collard greens grow in the ground, you'll want to give them a good wash before you use them. You can wash the greens cut or whole, but we suggest washing after cutting for the most thorough clean (just remember to rinse the cutting board and knife, too). Start by pulling or cutting the woody stem away from the leaves. Roughly cut the greens into two-inch pieces or strips. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) recommends rolling or folding the large leaves to make the process a little quicker and easier. Once the greens are cut, it's time to wash. Submerge the greens in water (using a large bowl or salad spinner) and allow the grit to fall to the bottom. Drain in a colander and rinse again under running water. Making a tender, flavorful pot of collard greens couldn't be easier. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe;,Begin by cooking bacon slices in a skillet until crisp. Remove the bacon from heat, crumble, and add back to the pan along with chopped onion and garlic. Next, add fresh cut collard greens to the mixture. Cook them gently, just until they begin to wilt, before pouring in broth and seasonings. Reduce heat and let the collard greens cook low and slow — about 45 minutes will result in silky, spicy greens that any Southern grandma would be proud to serve. These classic collard greens pair perfectly with all kinds of Southern dishes, from fried chicken to country ham. Nicole suggests serving them with barbecue chicken and cornbread for a down-home meal that'll please everyone at your table. Before cooking, fresh (and unwashed) collard greens can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days. They can also be frozen ahead of time — blanched greens can last for months in the freezer before cooking. What about leftovers? Southern collard greens are usually cooked in large batches, so freezing the remaining portions is a great way to have a delicious side dish on hand when you're short on time. Freeze cooked collard greens in small plastic bags as-is. They'll last up to 12 months. ""I just cooked these greens with black-eyed peas, cornbread, and pork chops, "" shares home cook Shelby.

Here are a few of her best pimento cheese tips and tricks:,· Make sure to grate your own cheese from the block. ""Do not buy that pre-shredded stuff, it is not going to be the same,"" warns Nicole.
· Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment is a great shortcut for making big batches of pimento cheese, according to Nicole. But don't mix until the pimentos are pulverized! Stop when the mixture is well-combined.
· Instead of pre-diced pimentos, Nicole likes to buy jarred and sliced pimentos to dice herself before adding them to the cheese mixture. Store the pimento cheese in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. You can freeze pimento cheese for up to three months. Though it will still taste delicious, the flavor might be slightly different after it has been frozen and thawed. ""Delicious as-is,"" according to one Allrecipes community member. ""Mix a dollop in with mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs or on top of a burger for a real treat!"",""This is absolutely AMAZING,"" raves DPerkins.

Southern Recipes,Authentic Louisiana Red Beans and Rice,"Looking for a hearty rice dish with a kick? This authentic Louisiana red beans and rice is a budget-friendly recipe with incredible Cajun flavor. Andouille sausage joins garden-fresh vegetables, zesty spices, and long grain rice in this deliciously down-home recipe. Learn all about this boldly savory dish, including tips on choosing the best beans and what to serve alongside it. This multifaceted Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe is made easier by breaking down the prep into small steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Start by soaking your beans overnight, and dicing any vegetables beforehand. When you're ready to begin, transfer the soaked beans to a large pot with water. Then, saute onions, bell peppers, garlic, and celery in an oiled skillet until a bit of color appears. Add the cooked vegetables, bay leaves, Cajun seasoning, and other spices to the beans. Bring the bean mixture to a boil before reducing the heat and allowing the ingredients to simmer for two to two and a half hours. Steam the rice during this time and set it aside. Add Andouille sausage to the beans and cook for an additional half-hour. After cooking, pour the spicy sausage and beans over rice, and enjoy a piping hot bowl of tender, meaty, and flavorful perfection. Red beans and kidney beans share a similar color, but they're actually two different types of legumes. Red beans are small, rounded, and have a faintly nutty taste. Red kidney beans are larger in size, with thicker skin and a slightly richer hue. Both can be used to make an appetizing red beans and rice dish, but dried kidney beans may have to soak longer before cooking. Using dry beans in this recipe ensures that they retain their shape during cooking. Dried beans should be soaked prior to cooking for easier digestion and faster cook time. There are two commonly used ways to soak beans: overnight or quick soak. The overnight method is incredibly simple — add beans to a large stockpot and cover them with twice their volume in water. Cover and let sit overnight. Quick soaking consists of bringing dried beans and water to a boil before removing them from heat and allowing the beans to sit for one to four hours (or until they're easily squeezed). Red beans and rice is a versatile recipe that can act as a main or side dish. The big, hearty flavors pair well with foods like cornbread, collard greens, barbecued meats, and fried chicken. Leftover red beans should be stored separately from rice to discourage mushiness. Place both components in their own sealed container and refrigerate for up to a week. To freeze your leftovers, place cooled, single servings of rice into freezer bags and top with a commensurate portion of beans. Tightly seal the bags, and freeze for up to three months. ""I'm a Louisiana boy who grew up eating red beans and rice, shares reviewer jChase. ""This recipe is the real deal. It's become a staple in my home and I serve it up twice a month."",""I made substitutions because I did not want to venture out to the market for ingredients I did not have,"" says home cook Rea. ""This time, I used chorizo sausage, celery powder, and green pepper from my garden. I recommend it as-is, or with personal adjustments!"",""All I can say is wow!"" raves Lesley.

Southern Recipes,Best Fried Green Tomatoes,"Southern-style fried green tomatoes are the crisp, tangy, and boldly savory appetizer you should be making all year. This classic, down-home dish features sliced unripe tomatoes that are dredged in flour and cornmeal before being skillet-fried to buttery-brown perfection. Our community of home cooks loves the simple seasonings and wonderful crunch of this old-fashioned recipe. Learn how to make, store, and freeze the tastiest fried green tomatoes ever. Green tomatoes are unripe red tomatoes with much firmer flesh and a sharp, tart flavor. Most are intentionally picked before maturing to ensure the crispest, driest fruit possible. Because they have a lower water content, green tomatoes are perfectly suitable for sauteeing and frying. Your fried tomatoes will hold up best if you cut them horizontally in ¼- to ½-inch thick slices. If you like, you can sprinkle a tiny pinch of sugar on each slice to chase away any lingering bitterness. Before frying, dredge the tomato slices in seasoned flour — or make a thicker breading: dip the slices lightly in flour, then in beaten egg, followed by a substantial coating of breadcrumbs, cornmeal, or cracker crumbs. For real down-home flavor, fry them in bacon grease (or a mix of bacon grease and vegetable oil). Whatever kind of fat you use, make sure it's around 375 degrees F for crispy golden-brown results. Half the fun of eating fried green tomatoes is dipping them in a creamy and flavorful sauce. Serve this Southern dish with zippy remoulade, honey mustard, or a sweet chili sauce for an incredibly delicious finish. Whip up your sauce ahead of time so the flavors have time to meld as you prepare and cook the fried green tomatoes. Although fried green tomatoes are best enjoyed piping hot and perfectly crisp, you can store them in the refrigerator for one to two days. Keep them in an airtight container, and reheat in an oiled skillet, oven, or air fryer. After being cooked, fried green tomatoes are not great candidates for freezing. But sliced and battered green tomatoes can be stored safely in the freezer for up to a year. Simply pat tomatoes dry, dip them in egg wash, dredge in a flour-cornmeal mixture, then freeze. Use an airtight container or freezer bag to hold the battered tomatoes. You'll have zesty, Southern-style goodness ready to pop into the skillet year-round. Culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) says these fried green tomatoes are perfectly crunchy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making these ""summer delights:"",""Just made this and it was fantastic!"" raves home cook Larry. ""I love fried green tomatoes and this one hit the bullseye. Will definitely use this one again. It reminded me of when I was young and my mom made it."",""This is a quick summer meal with a salad or cottage cheese out on the patio next to the pool,"" shares TBIRD.

Southern Recipes,Fresh Southern Peach Cobbler,"Classic peach cobbler is always a hit when peaches are at their peak. This particular cobbler has over 3,000 five-star ratings, so we're confident you'll be thrilled with the results, too. A warm mixture of sweetened, juicy peaches is topped with a biscuit-like dough and sprinkled in cinnamon sugar. Although it's made from scratch with fresh peaches, this easy peach cobbler is incredibly simple and comes together in just one hour. No fresh peaches? See below for tips on using canned or frozen peaches during the off season. A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name ""cobbler"" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort. In the case of peach cobbler, fresh, frozen, or canned peaches may be combined with sugar, spices, lemon juice, and cornstarch (for thickening). As with all cobblers, it's finished off with a biscuit-like topping and sprinkled with a cinnamon-sugar mixture. Although it's hard to beat a ripe, juicy peach during peak season, canned (well-drained) and frozen peaches (thawed and drained) make a great alternative when fresh is not an option. Reviewers say they had success with both canned and frozen peaches:,Picking a perfectly ripe peach can seem tricky, but you can rely on three simple sensory cues: look, touch, and smell. A ripe peach will have a golden-hue near the stem, it should give slightly to your grip, and it will have a sweet and fragrant smell. If your peaches aren't ripe, here's the good news: They will continue to ripen with a little patience. Place unripe peaches on the counter stem-side-down at room temperature until ripe. Most folks choose to peel their peaches, but you can absolutely leave the skin on. The skin will soften as it bakes and be far less noticeable once cooked. If you do choose to peel them you can do so one of two ways:,It just wouldn’t be summer without a homemade peach cobbler, according to culinary developer and test kitchen expert Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her favorite tips and tricks for a perfect cobbler every time:,While it is best right out of the oven (with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, of course!), cobbler will keep covered in the fridge for up to four days. To reheat, microwave to your desired temperature or bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 20 minutes, or until warmed through.

Southern Recipes,Sweet Potato Pie,"There's nothing like a freshly baked sweet potato pie to usher in the holiday season. The autumnal dessert just tastes like home, doesn't it? This top-rated sweet potato pie recipe, which is subtly spiced with ingredients you probably already have on hand, has been beloved by the Allrecipes community for decades. Learn how to make, store, freeze, and serve the best sweet potato pie of your life with this community favorite recipe. If you have fresh sweet potatoes and a few kitchen staples, you likely have everything you need to make this homemade sweet potato pie. Sweet potato and pumpkin pies are both autumnal desserts that are popular during the cooler months, particularly during the holiday season. Pumpkin pie has a milder flavor that's typically flavored with a lot of spices. Sweet potatoes are naturally a bit sweeter and flavorful, so sweet potato pie doesn't usually feature as many spices.

You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Yes, you can make sweet potato pie ahead of time! It's a great idea if you're prepping for a holiday and want to conserve oven space on the big day. Store sweet potato pie in the fridge, covered tightly in storage wrap or aluminum foil, for three to four days. You should refrigerate the pie as soon as it has cooled to room temperature. You can absolutely freeze sweet potato pie — and you should if you want to get a jump-start on holiday baking. To freeze sweet potato pie, bake it in an aluminum pie plate (aluminum is thinner than ceramic alternatives, so it will help the pie freeze faster and prevent the development of ice crystals). Cover the cooled pie in several layers of storage wrap. Top the storage wrap with a layer of aluminum foil. Thaw in the fridge overnight.

Russian,Taylor's Piroshki,"To make the filling: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Stir in onion; cook and stir until onion has softened. Season with salt, pepper, and dill weed to taste. Allow to cool before using. Meanwhile, to make the dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water and place in a warm location until frothy, about 10 to 15 minutes. Warm milk in a medium saucepan over low heat; gently whisk in eggs, oil, sugar, and salt. Remove from heat. Place 1/2 of the flour in a large mixing bowl and gradually stir in the milk mixture. Add yeast solution alternately with remaining flour, stirring after each addition; mix well. Knead until the dough forms a ball and does not stick to the bowl. (Note: Start with the 4 cups of flour. You may need to add more, a little at a time, as you knead the dough). Cover the bowl with a clean cloth. Set in a warm location and allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 30 to 60 minutes. Remove dough from bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Pinch off pieces approximately the size of golf balls. Roll the pieces into disks about 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter. Fill the center of each disk with a heaping tablespoon of cooled beef mixture. Fold disks over the mixture and firmly pinch the edges to seal. Arrange on a flat surface and allow to sit for approximately 10 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Russian,Russian Pelmeni,"Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic. Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside. Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside. Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out. Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for 5 more minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon. You can use a mixture of 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef. You can also use ground turkey. You can make the meat filling by processing the filling ingredients through a meat grinder. Only use a blender or food processor if you have a special setting for meat. If you're not a fan of raw onion, you can sauté the onion in butter over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes before using it in the filling. You can make the dough in a Kitchen Aid; mix until the dough begins to form a ball. In Russia, people often use a pelmeni mold to form dumplings. To use one, roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface. You should end up with a circle slightly bigger than the mold. Place onto the mold, floured-side down. Place about 1 teaspoon filling into each cell. Cover with another thinly rolled dough circle and sprinkle with flour. Roll a rolling pin over the top until pelmeni start popping out from the mold. Gather remaining dough and add a little bit of new dough to it. Roll out again, repeating the process with remaining dough and filling. To fry pelmeni: Melt butter or bacon grease in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté frozen pelmeni in hot butter until soft and meat is cooked through, just like a pierogi.","1 large egg, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon salt, ¾ cup warm water, or more as needed, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour for dusting",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F7933366.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true,Pelmeni are Russian meat-filled dumplings.

Persian,Sabzi Polo (Green Herb Rice),"Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses. Cover rice with cold water, add 1 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour. Drain rice without rinsing. Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside. Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 12 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 4 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Add rice, stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook rice until the first piece pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more. Drain rice in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste rice and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot. Combine chopped fresh parsley, cilantro, dill, and chives with dried dill in a medium bowl. Gently combine herb mixture with rice in the colander, taking care not to break the grains of rice. Place the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Trim or tear lavash bread and cover the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer. Gently scatter rice-herb mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure lavash is completely covered. Place garlic stalks on top at the outer edges of the rice. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, 10 to 13 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface. Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot.

Norwegian,Norwegian Potato Flatbread (Lefse),"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line an oven-safe skillet or baking pan with aluminum foil. Poke the potato skin all over with a knife and place on the prepared pan. Roast in the preheated oven until very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Let sit until cool enough to handle but still very warm. Scoop potato flesh out into a bowl. Mash smooth with the back of a spatula until there are no lumps left. You can also use a potato ricer. Add the butter and mix until it disappears. Add the salt, sugar, and cream; mix until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Mix in flour in several additions until the dough is able to be kneaded by hand. Add enough flour to form a soft, but not too sticky, dough. You need to be able to roll it out fairly thin without it falling apart. Wrap dough with plastic and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Divide dough into 8 portions. Dust each with flour and roll out onto a well-floured kitchen towel to 1/8-inch thick, or thinner. Heat a very lightly buttered nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook the lefse in the hot pan, poking the surface lightly with a fork, until golden brown blisters form, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stack on a plate as they're cooked and keep covered with a towel. Serve warm. Your russet potato should weight about 18 ounces raw, which yields about 12 ounces once cooked and scooped out. Feel free to substitute regular milk for the cream.

Norwegian,Kransekake (Norwegian Almond Ring Cake),"Impress everyone at your holiday party with this traditional kransekake. It's stunning, delicious, and easier to make than you might think. Kransekake is a traditional Danish and Norwegian dessert made of cookie-like cake rings that are layered in concentric rings to form a cone-shaped cake. The layers are ""glued"" together with sugary icing. Made with ground almonds, egg whites, and confectioners' sugar, kransekake has a light texture and nutty flavor that's impossible to resist. Here's what you'll need to make this homemade kransekake recipe:,· Confectioners' sugar: You'll need a little over six cups of confectioners for this kransekake recipe (4 ⅓ for the cake and two for the icing).
· Ground almonds: Both blanched (almonds with their skins removed) and unblanched ground almonds are necessary for this recipe.
· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.
· Egg whites: No yolks are needed for this light and airy kransekake recipe! Three egg whites go into the cake and one goes into the icing.
· Lemon juice: A teaspoon of lemon juice enhances the overall flavor of the icing and adds subtle brightness.
· Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract is another subtle flavor enhancer for the 4-ingredient icing. Tip: If you purchased whole almonds, it is easiest to grind them in a coffee grinder or specialized nut grinder. Once ground, sift them to make sure all big chunks are taken out, and regrind those chunks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this gorgeous kransekake:,1. Make the dough: Mix the dry ingredients, then stir in the egg whites. Knead the dough until it holds itself together.
2. Shape the dough: Roll the dough into 18 ropes of increasingly long lengths. Shape the ropes into rings.
3. Bake the dough: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until it's golden brown. Let them cool completely.
4. Make the icing: Whisk the egg white and gradually add the remaining icing ingredients. Pour it into a piping bag.
5. Assemble the cake: Use the icing to assemble the cake according to the detailed instructions below. Tip: If you have special kransekake molds, use those to shape and bake the dough.Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,The icing in this recipe contains raw egg. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and the infirm do not consume raw egg. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine confectioners' sugar, ground almonds, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in egg whites, one at a time, to form a firm dough. Knead dough for 2 minutes until it holds together and doesn't fall apart easily. Roll dough into 18 ropes the thickness of your index finger, each rope a little longer than the next. Shape each rope into a ring. Arrange rings on the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch smaller cookie rings carefully, as they may finish baking before the larger ones. Let cookies cool completely on baking sheets. To make the icing: Whisk egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually whisk in confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, until thickened; stir in lemon juice and vanilla extract. Pour icing into a piping bag fitted with a small tip. Pipe a thin ring of icing onto the base of the largest ring and adhere it to a serving plate. Pipe icing in a zig-zag pattern over the ring. Stack remaining cake rings on top, from largest to smallest, piping icing in a zig-zag pattern between each ring. Set aside to allow icing to set before serving.","4 ⅓ cups sifted confectioners' sugar, 2 ½ cups finely ground blanched almonds, 2 ½ cups finely ground unblanched almonds, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 3  egg whites",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F9075432.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true,Kransekake is a traditional Norwegian cake made with almond cookie rings that are stacked to form a tower.

Norwegian,Original Kumla Recipe from Mom,"Place the ham in a large soup pot (at least 10 quart size), and pour in 16 to 20 cups of water to cover. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer the ham to make a rich stock, about 2 hours. Remove the ham, and skim any foam off the broth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste) to broth, if necessary. Place the potatoes in a large bowl, and use very wet hands to mix in the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt to make a sticky dough. Bring the ham stock to a full, rolling boil. Place a bowl of water near the stove. With very wet hands, pinch off about 2/3 cup of dough, and press a piece of bacon into the center of the dough. Roll the dough into a ball about 2 1/2 inches across, and slip the kumla into the boiling broth along the side of the pot. Don't drop them into the middle of the broth to avoid splashing the hot broth. Repeat with the remaining dough, using the bowl of water to keep your hands very wet, until all the dumplings have been added to the broth. Cover and simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes, then use a slotted spoon or spatula to gently lift any stuck dumplings from the bottom of the pot. Cover the pot again, and simmer the dumplings for about 1 hour. They will float to the top of the broth as they cook. Gently lift the kumla from the broth with a slotted spoon, and stack them in a bowl for serving. Sprinkle with salt and pepper before serving. Taste the broth, and if necessary, add salt to taste.

Malaysian,Malaysian Flatbread (Roti Canai) with Curried Lentil Dip,"Sometimes the ""food wishes"" I get take years, or even a decade, before they make an appearance on the channel. Other times, as was the case with this amazing Malaysian Flatbread (Roti Canai), they are granted almost instantaneously. I saw the request in the morning, and by that afternoon, after several minutes of exhaustive research, I'd already started experimenting. I'm a huge fan of flatbreads, no matter where they're from, or how they're shaped. I probably shouldn't call this beginner's luck, since I do have a lot of experience working with these types of things, but still, I was happily surprised with just how well they came out. As I demonstrated in the video, I still need to work on the old drop-the-folded-dough-on-the-table trick, but all in all, I was pretty pleased with myself. While this fantastic flatbread would be incredible dipped into anything, the simple and relatively fast red lentil curry was a perfect pairing. You could also make this more substantial by adding extra vegetables, some chicken, or lamb into the mix. No matter how you enjoy yours, I really do hope you give this roti canai a try soon.

Combine bread flour, sugar, kosher salt, egg, melted butter, and water for roti canai in a mixing bowl. Mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a work surface and knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 7 minutes. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces and form each one into a ball. Coat each ball with vegetable oil, transfer to a plate, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 8 hours, to overnight. Melt butter for dip in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, ginger, garlic, kosher salt, curry powder, paprika, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir together and saute until onion has softened and spices are fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until it starts to toast and caramelize on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. Stir in cold water and coconut milk. Add lentils; stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Reduce heat to low and keep warm while you prepare the roti canai. Place 1/4 cup melted butter in a bowl. Transfer rested dough balls onto a lightly oiled work surface. Flatten each ball slightly and rub a little melted butter on top. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let it warm up slightly, about 10 minutes. Press on top of the plastic wrap to flatten warmed dough. Remove plastic wrap and add a bit more butter. Stretch each piece from the center out to get it as thin as possible (until almost see-through), adding more butter as needed. Don't worry if there are a few small tears. Sprinkle on more melted butter, then pull two sides in towards the center until touching and overlapping slightly. Pull the other two edges in the same way to form a square. Cover with plastic wrap and flatten roti canai one more time. Add some melted butter to a skillet set over medium or medium-low heat. Add roti canai and cook until browned, flaky, and crispy on the outside and fully cooked through on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and smush it with your hands to fluff it up and separate the layers of dough. Repeat to cook remaining roti canai.

Jewish,Jewish Apple Cake,"This Jewish apple cake is a must on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, as apples represent the hope for a sweet year ahead. Dipping them in honey (a traditional snack) and baking them into desserts sets up the year to be even sweeter. Of course, this cake would be just as delicious any time of year or any time of day. Cake for breakfast, anyone?,If your family follows kosher rules (Jewish laws on food and drink that include not mixing meat and dairy in the same meal) this cake is a keeper. It's dairy-free, substituting oil for butter and orange juice for milk, and can be enjoyed with any pareve meal that has meat as the main. Serve it as a show-stopping finale to your Hanukkah meal, or for a sweet midday snack with a mug of tea or coffee. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Jewish apple cake:,Apple varieties that have more pectin, a natural starch that helps them hold their shape and thickens their juices, are best for baking. Having more pectin is less important for a cake than a pie as the batter is more forgiving. For this Jewish apple cake, reviewers loved tart Granny Smith and sweet Gala apples. A tube pan has high curved sides. This pan is typically used for angel food cake, giving the whipped batter lots of room for a tall rise in the oven. The tube in the middle helps to distribute the heat more evenly so the middle of the cake won't be undercooked. A Bundt pan is shorter and has lots of curves and ridges. The apple-rich batter of this Jewish apple cake wouldn't fill those indentations as evenly, so you'd get less definition than with a traditional Bundt cake. If you don't have a tube pan though, a Bundt pan will work just as well (be sure to check for doneness with a toothpick towards the end of baking). The beauty of this Jewish apple cake recipe is its simplicity: By adding a few spices or a glaze, you can easily make it your own. Many reviewers used apple pie spice in place of cinnamon for more fall flavor. One user drizzled over a brown butter glaze and another used caramel sauce. Using what she had on hand, reviewer Regina Hoag used a combo of apples and pears and vanilla and almond extracts. Everyone had rave-worthy results. Stored in an airtight container, this Jewish apple cake will keep on your counter in a cool kitchen for a couple of days. Store in the fridge for about a week. If your cake doesn't fit in a container, try placing it on a large plate or the lid of a large mixing bowl. Top with the upturned bowl to cover. To freeze the apple cake, cool completely, wrap well in plastic wrap and foil, and freeze for up to three months. To reheat, thaw the frozen cake in your fridge overnight. Unwrap, place on a foil-lined baking sheet, and place in a 300 degrees F oven for about 15 minutes until warmed through. ""Absolutely the best apple cake,"" says Janice Peiffer. ""Not too much spice, moist, and delicious. My family loved this. Followed the recipe as written."",""I have made this cake so many times over the years and it is always a hit with family and friends,"" writes Carole Bell-Hehman.

Transfer dough to the prepared work surface; knead rapidly and firmly until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces; cut each piece in half to get 8 pieces. Swiftly roll each piece into a ball. Working from the center, roll out each dough piece into a 5-inch-diameter round, dusting with flour as needed. Continue to gradually roll dough out to a diameter of about 8 inches, increasing each size by about 1 inch, then letting dough rest for a few seconds before rolling again to the finished size. The dough rounds will be very thin. Use a fork to quickly pierce through each dough round about 25 times, all over, to prevent rising. Flip dough over and pierce each piece again 25 times. With at least 5 minutes left on the timer, remove the hot baking sheet from the preheated oven and place dough rounds onto the baking sheet.

Whether you stick to the classic, top with poppy or sesame seeds, add golden raisins, shape it, stuff it, or swirl it, challah is one of the best (and easiest) breads to make at home. Read on to learn all about challah, from its symbolism in Judaism to how to braid, freeze, and use it (besides tearing big pieces right from the loaf). Challah bread is a white, leavened, braided bread with Ashkenazi Jewish origins. It's typically made with eggs, yeast, flour, honey (or sugar), and salt. Challah is a staple of every Jewish table on the sabbath — Friday evening to Saturday evening — and many Jewish holidays like Hanukkah and Yom Kippur (it's often the first food eaten to break the fast). Challah bread is also part of many important Jewish rituals, from weddings to funerals and nearly every occasion in between.The way the challah is braided or shaped also has its own meaning in Judaism. A three-stand brand symbolizes truth, peace, and justice. A braid with twelve ""humps"" represents the twelve tribes of Israel. Round or spiral-shaped challahs are eaten during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, as a symbol of the cycle of the seasons. Both types of bread have lots of eggs and are known for their richness. The big difference here is butter. In a brioche, lots and lots of butter is incorporated into the dough. Challah is made without butter so it can be pareve (PAR-reve), or kosher in a meal that includes meat (Jews who keep kosher don't mix meat and dairy in the same meal). You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make challah bread at home:,1. Activate the yeast.
2. Make the dough.
3. Turn out and knead the dough.
4. Let the dough rise.
5. Roll and braid the dough according to the below directions.
6. Let the dough rise again.
7. Add an egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds.
8. Bake the challah bread until golden brown. Once your dough has risen, divide into three equal pieces and gently roll into 11/2-inch-thick ropes with the palms of your hands (the ropes should be about the same length). Pinch the ropes together at one end and braid fairly tightly. Pinch the opposite ends together. Tuck the ends underneath the loaf. Place your challah in a resealable bag and press out all the air before sealing. Freeze for up to three months or leave on your counter to enjoy all week. The oil and the extra eggs in challah bread help it stay soft longer than other loaves. And when it starts to go stale, it's time for bread pudding or French toast!,Challah can absorb lots of liquid without falling apart, making it perfect for a custardy bread pudding, French toast, or even your Thanksgiving stuffing. Use challah in simple sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly is a fave) but skip it for sandwiches that need something sturdier, like a grilled cheese or a sandwich with lots of heavy fillings. ""This was a great easy to follow recipe,"" says reviewer jen. Delicious and quite true to Brooklyn bakery Challah bread!"". ""My first time making challah and this was so easy to follow. It turned out great! Very eggy and a little sweet, like a dense Hawaiian bread,"" user Vanessa Armand wrote.

Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Beat in honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt.

Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half and knead each half for 5 minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep it from getting sticky. Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Pinch the ends of the three snakes together firmly and braid from middle. Either leave as a braid or form into a round braided loaf by bringing ends together, curving the braid into a circle, and pinching ends together.

Jewish,Real Homemade Bagels,"Make bagels: Combine water, flour, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low speed until dough is well-developed, about 8 minutes. To ensure the gluten has developed fully, cut off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Flour your fingers, and then stretch the dough: if it tears immediately, the dough needs more kneading. Fully developed dough should form a thin translucent ""windowpane."",Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let rise for 2 hours. Punch dough down, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and use a knife or dough scraper to divide the dough into 6 pieces (or more, for smaller bagels). Roll each piece of dough into a sausage shape about 6 inches long. Join the ends to form a circle. Repeat with the remaining dough, and let the bagels rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange small plates with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and onion flakes next to the baking sheet.

This miso soup recipe is bold, flavorful, and easy to make with just five ingredients. Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice. The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions. It can also feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and more. Miso soup is traditionally served with rice. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:,These are the basic, easy-to-find ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated miso soup recipe:,· Water: This easy miso soup recipe starts with four cups of water.

· Green onions: Diced green onions add a burst of color and flavor. Miso paste comes in red, white, and yellow varieties. The type you use for soup is up to you and your preferences, but restaurants usually use red miso because it has the deepest flavor. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make classic miso soup at home:,1. Bring the water and dashi granules to a boil.
2. Reduce the heat and whisk in miso paste.
3. Stir in the tofu and green onions.

Japanese,Perfect Sushi Rice,"The first step to perfect homemade sushi? Perfect homemade sushi rice. This top-rated sushi rice recipe comes together quickly on the stove with just a few basic ingredients you probably already have on hand. Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls. The best rice for sushi is short-grain Japanese rice — this is what's in the bags labeled ""sushi rice"" at the store. This glutinous rice has a higher starch content than other varieties, which gives it the sticky texture you're after when you make sushi. Classic sushi rice is seasoned with just rice vinegar, white sugar, and salt. This recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of a bolder oil, so the simple seasonings have a chance to really shine. You can make sushi rice on the stove, in a rice cooker, or even in an Instant Pot. Our stovetop method is as easy as it gets. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed. Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky — it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools. ""I really loved this recipe,"" raves Phillippa Molnar. ""When I added the sugar and everything to the rice I panicked thinking it tasted too sweet, but then the rice absorbed it and the flavour became more subtle like it was meant to be. I've actually made it a few times because I think it's such a refreshing meal and it's so fun to make with family and friends as a relaxed fun evening."",""This sushi rice really is perfect,"" says Mandy. ""I always follow this when I'm making sushi rolls for my family. The only thing I do differently is reduce the salt down to ¼ tsp. I do this primarily because we dip our sushi in soy sauce and that gives us plenty of salt."",""This recipe is excellent,"" according to SamX. ""I've used it half a dozen times with just a pot on the stove and it works great every time. I did make one change which for me, was a game changer. Instead of using vegetable oil in the flavor mix, I use 1 teaspoon of TOASTED sesame oil. All I can say is WOW! If you do try it just be mindful of nut allergies. But I'm telling you it's worth even making a separate batch!"",Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,Gather all ingredients. Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water until the water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool, then stir into the cooked rice.

Japanese,Chef John's Miso Soup,"Miso Soup – In and Out,I don't like to start a meal with soup. I much prefer to begin with something light, slightly acidic, and subtly bitter to get the taste buds going, and to further stimulate my appetite. Soups are usually filling, and there's nothing worse, culinarily speaking, than being satiated before the final courses are served. The one huge exception to this would be miso soup. Whenever I go to a Japanese restaurant, before the sashimi, the sushi, the katsu, and the tempura appear, I have to have a nice, steaming bowl of miso soup. It's rich and satisfying, but doesn't leave me feeling full. In fact, it somehow stimulates my appetite unlike any other soup I know. It's one of my favorite parts of any Japanese meal, and I always look forward to its warm, comforting embrace. So then, why don't I make it more often at home? I wish I had a good answer for that. It's fast, easy, cheap, and if you live anywhere near a city (or have internet access) the ingredients are not hard to find. Maybe enjoying it in the restaurant setting, before all that other wonderful food arrives is part of the magic, but after doing this video, I'm promising myself I'll make this at home a lot more often, and I hope you do the same. Enjoy!,Gather all ingredients. Pour cold water into a saucepan. Add kombu and soak for 30 minutes. Set pan on the stove over medium heat, and wait until water just starts to simmer.

Greek,Greek Baklava,"Believe it or not, you can make Greek restaurant-worthy baklava in the comfort of your own kitchen — and it's actually not that hard! This top-rated baklava recipe, which is surprisingly approachable for beginner bakers, has racked up almost 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community. Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary syrup. Pronounce ""baklava"" like ""bah-klah-vah."" The stress is placed on the first syllable. Though baklava is often associated with Greek restaurants now, its exact origins are unclear. Food historians think modern baklava may have been invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire, then modified in Greece. However, the technique of layering unleavened bread with nuts and honey can be traced back as far as the 8th century B.C.E. during the Assyrian Empire. Here's what you need to make the best baklava of your life:,Phyllo Dough
Make your own phyllo pastry dough or buy frozen phyllo dough at the store. Nuts
Chopped walnuts, pistachios, or a mixture of both are traditionally used. Hazelnuts and/or pecans would also work. Butter
Not only does butter add richness and flavor, it keeps the phyllo sheets moist and soft. It also helps the sheets stay together. Cinnamon
Cinnamon is responsible for baklava's signature warmth. Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey
A sweet syrup — made from water, sugar, vanilla extract, and honey — is poured over the baked baklava layers, bringing the delicious dessert together. Even though making baklava can be a bit time-consuming, it's probably not as hard as you think. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect. Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer. Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp. Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving. Baklava is super sugary, so it has a relatively long shelf-life. It will last for about two weeks stored in an airtight container. Keep it in the pantry if you like your baklava crispy. If you like it chewy, opt for the fridge. Yes, you can definitely freeze baklava. Just let it cool completely, wrap it in a layer of storage wrap, and then a layer of aluminum foil. Follow with another layer of aluminum foil for added protection. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. When culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) tried this top-rated baklava recipe, she declared it the ""perfect make-ahead dessert."" Here are a few of the best tips and tricks she learned along the way:,· Chop the nuts in a food processor to save time.
· Ensure the phyllo sheets stay moist during the layering process by keeping the stack covered with a damp paper towel or cloth.
· Worried about tearing the dough when you brush it with butter? Don't be! If you're concerned, Nicole suggests spraying melted butter onto the phyllo dough between layers instead of brushing it.
· If the phyllo dough sticks to your hands while you work with it, place a bowl of water next to your prep station. Keeping your fingertips moist will prevent sticking.
· When it's time to eat, consider serving (and storing) the baklava pieces in cupcake liners to nip sticky fingers in the bud. ""Definitely use a spritzer bottle for the melted butter, it cuts down on the time,"" says Dionne Sharp Ukleja. "" It made the assembly easy and effortless!"",""My husband and I have tried making homemade baklava a couple of times, and this is by FAR the BEST recipe we have used,"" raves jlgarnet. ""We followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly!"",""This is an amazing recipe,"" raves cookingmom. ""I added more cinnamon, but other than that I don't think any changes need to be made! The result has the perfect crispness and flavor! Excellent recipe!"",Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan. Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp. Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.

French,Chicken Cordon Bleu,"Don't feel like going out tonight? You can easily make a gourmet restaurant-worthy meal in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated chicken cordon bleu recipe. It's impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think. A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked. Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. ""Cordon bleu"" translates to ""blue ribbon."" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs. There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Chicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.

French,Rich and Simple French Onion Soup,"There's nothing cozier than a warm bowl of freshly made French onion soup. With this top-rated recipe, you can make restaurant-worthy French onion soup in the comfort of your own kitchen. Plus, get our best ingredient tips and storage secrets.

The soup is topped with bread and cheese, then gratinéed to rich, gooey perfection. It's traditionally served in a ramekin or a ceramic crock with a handle. French onion soup is traditionally topped with Gruyère, but other cheeses can be used. Most French onion soups are topped with three cheeses for maximum decadence. This recipe calls for Parmesan, provolone, and Swiss. Other popular choices include Fontina and mozzarella. No matter which cheeses you choose, make sure not to skimp! French onion soup should be rich and indulgent. French onion soup is traditionally made with thinly sliced yellow onions. You can also make delicious soup with red or white onions – it just depends on your flavor preferences and what you have on hand.

To reheat French onion soup, bring it to a boil on the stove. You can add more broiled bread and cheese if you want to go the extra mile, but you can use store-bought croutons for quick and easy results.

Chinese,Perfect Pot Stickers,"Whether served as an appetizer or full-blown main dish, pot stickers are always a winning choice. Packed with savory flavors, Chef John's pot stickers are a little different because they're fried, steamed, and fried again for a delightfully crispy bottom with a tender, juicy filling. Be sure to bookmark this irresistible recipe because you'll be making these homemade pot stickers again and again. Pot stickers are a type of dumpling that are believed to have originated in China. Pot stickers are typically filled with ground pork and cabbage, but they can be stuffed with other ingredients too. They're usually pan-fried and steamed to give a soft, tender texture to the filling and a crunchy texture to the dumpling dough. You'll find the fully involved recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Combine ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, cayenne, and cabbage in a bowl. Mix until combined and refrigerate until chilled and ready to use. Slowly pour hot water over flour and kosher salt. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough ball into four equal pieces (keep the other pieces covered while working). Roll the dough into a log and divide into six equal pieces. Roll each piece into a pot sticker wrapper. Repeat until all dough is used. Place a small amount of pork filling into the center of each wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper and fold the two sides together. Pinch the edges together. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to flatten it, then add a slight curve so it can stand on its own. Combine rice vinegar and soy sauce in a bowl. Set aside until ready to serve. Pan-fry the pot stickers until golden brown. Add water and steam for three minutes. Uncover and continue to pan-fry until water has evaporated and the pot stickers are crunchy. We love Chef John's method for cooking pot stickers. For crunchy, yet tender pot stickers, first pan-fry them in oil until the bottoms are golden brown. Add water to the skillet and cover — steam the pot stickers for three minutes. Uncover and allow to pan-fry again until the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pot stickers are crunchy. Chef John's dipping sauce for pot stickers is super simple and delicious. Just combine soy sauce and rice vinegar in a bowl. To dress up the sauce, you can also add hot sauce, garlic, minced green onions, or ginger. Store leftover pot stickers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave until warmed through. If you want the crispy bottom, reheat in the microwave until warmed through, then pan-fry in oil until crispy. Uncooked pot stickers are freezer-friendly. Simply follow the recipe until the pot stickers are assembled, but don't cook them yet. Transfer the pot stickers to a baking sheet and flash freeze them for a few hours (or until they're frozen solid). Transfer the now-frozen pot stickers to a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. When you're ready to eat, there's no need to thaw the pot stickers. Simply follow this recipe to cook them from frozen. However, you may need to add a few minutes of cook time to account for the frozen temperature. ""My 17 yr old daughter said: 'It was better than restaurant quality,' says Denise Perchall. ""I did use wonton wrappers from the grocery, instead of making my own dough.

Chinese,Asian Orange Chicken,"You don't have to go out to enjoy delicious, Asian-inspired cuisine! Make your own orange chicken at home with this top-rated recipe. Over 1,300 Allrecipes community members have rated this recipe 5 stars, so you already know it's going to be great!,Have some rice on deck because you won't be able to resist the temptation of immediately biting into this sweet and sticky chicken. Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants. It consists of small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in an orange sauce. The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint of spice. It's mainly known for its orange flavor (as you can guess from the name). It's typically made with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus flavor. Even though you see orange chicken at Chinese restaurants in America, it's not a typical Chinese dish. Instead, it was popularized by American Chinese restaurants — alongside General Tso's chicken, which is also not traditional Chinese food. You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making orange chicken:,Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then let cool. Once cool, transfer to a zip-top bag with chicken and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours. After the chicken is marinated, coat it in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook it in a skillet until it's brown on both sides. Add the sauce to an empty skillet and bring it to a boil. Add cornstarch and water (to thicken it), then the chicken pieces. Let it simmer until everything is combined. Store orange chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for three to five days. Reheat the chicken in a skillet — you may need to add water to fix the sauce's consistency. Freeze orange chicken in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag for up to three months. Let thaw in the refrigerator overnight. ""I made this for my family and got raves. I didn't have any green onions so I left onion out and I cut back a little bit on the red pepper flakes. It was so good. I served it with brown rice and it was perfect. I didn't have any leftovers even though I used 4 chicken breasts. I will definitely be making this again,"" according to Carol. ""LOVED this recipe. Time intensive, but worth the effort. I used fresh oranges and lemons for juice. I made brown rice and stir fried snow peas, broccoli flowers, grated carrots, and diced red peppers. Rice went on the plate first, followed by the veggies, then the chicken, and last the sauce. Delish,"" raves jenvan. ""My family, even my 13 year old grandson, loved it. The only change was the marinating for 2 hours. It was a last minute dinner idea and I didn't have 2 hours so I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it worked out fine. Next time though I will cook the chicken in small batches as it didn't all get as crispy as I would have liked,"" says Firebird91. Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink,Gather all ingredients.

Chinese,Quick Beef Stir-Fry,"Need to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients? Look no further than a classic beef stir-fry. This beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them!,This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made. The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result. After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds. Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer. Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever,Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck. Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying. If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil. If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches. When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results. ""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,"" says Tiana Marie Ginorio. ""Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time. I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat,"" adds Allrecipes Allstar France C. ""Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me.

Cajun and Creole,Deep-Fried Turkey,"Fill a turkey fryer or large stockpot with enough oil to fry turkey; be sure to leave room for turkey so oil doesn't spill over. Heat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Layer a large platter with food-safe paper bags. Rinse turkey and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Rub seasoning inside the cavity and all over the outer surfaces. Make sure the hole at the neck is open at least 2 inches so oil can flow freely into the cavity. Turn off the heat source. Place whole onion into the drain basket followed by turkey, neck-end first. Slowly lower the basket into the fryer until turkey is completely submerged in oil. Turn on the heat source and cook, maintaining oil temperature at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes, or 3 1/2 minutes per pound. Carefully remove the basket from the fryer and drain turkey. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) but no more than 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Transfer turkey to the prepared platter to finish draining, 10 to 15 minutes. You can use vegetable oil instead of peanut oil if preferred. We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.","3 gallons peanut oil for frying, or as needed, 1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed, ¼ cup Creole seasoning, 1 medium white onion",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F7382441.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true,This is an awesome deep-fried turkey recipe made with Creole seasoning.

Cajun and Creole,Cajun Spice Mix,"Cajun spice mix is a Louisiana seasoning that packs a punch when it comes to flavors. The delicious (and mildly spicy) seasoning lends itself to so many wonderful dishes — like pastas, shrimp, chicken, fish, and much, much more. If you've never made your own Cajun spice mix at home, just know that not only are you missing out on great flavors — you're also missing out on savings. That's right, homemade Cajun seasoning tastes better and it's cheaper than store-bought! Do you need any more reasons to try this recipe?,Cajun seasoning hails from Louisiana, which is home to Cajun cuisine. The cuisine is a wonderful blend of Native American, West African, Caribbean, and French cooking styles. Cajun seasoning is a blend of spices that create a spicy, earthy, and sometimes smoky flavor. Typical Cajun seasonings (including store-bought like Slap Ya Mama and Tony Chachere's) are made with black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. For different flavors, some Cajun spice mixes include salt, mustard powder, chile peppers, or cumin. This spice mix also includes oregano and thyme, which you don't normally see in Cajun spice mixes — those are typically found in Creole spice mixes. Creole cuisine, which also originated in Louisiana, is a mixture of African, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish cooking styles. So, Creole seasoning typically has more herbs than Cajun seasoning. Creole seasoning is made with black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, thyme, basil, and oregano. Sometimes, you might find bay leaves, rosemary, or parsley in it too. So, Creole seasoning has a light spicy kick, but it has more aromatics to balance it out than Cajun seasoning does. Learn more: What's the Difference Between Cajun and Creole?,Blackened seasoning can be described as a mixture between Cajun seasoning and Creole seasoning. It's quite spicy (from the cayenne or chili powder), but it also contains aromatic herbs (like oregano, thyme, and basil). Blackened seasoning is also different from Cajun seasoning in the way it's used. The term ""blackened"" doesn't really have anything to do with the seasoning itself, but in the way the food is prepared. The protein, like fish, shrimp, or chicken, is drenched in butter, then heavily coated in blackened seasoning and seared. The blackened seasoning will create a blackened crust on the outside of the food after a few minutes of cooking. Making homemade spice mixes is so easy, there's really no excuse not to do it! Simply stir all the ingredients together in a bowl until well combined, then store in an airtight container or jar. Cajun seasoning is great on protein, like chicken, fish, shrimp, and steak, but it's also delicious in pasta dishes, rice, and stuffed peppers.
