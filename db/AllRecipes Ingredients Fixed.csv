Thai,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken ,"Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. Sauce
Chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. Chicken
Chef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlic
Sliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppers
This is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. Basil
This recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."",There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves. Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil?,Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."",""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too. The trick is a very hot wok ( hopefully) or skillet."",Editorial contributions by Vanessa Greaves,Gather ingredients.

Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.

Swedish,Traditional Swedish Pepparkakor,"This pepparkakor recipe produces irresistibly crisp cookies that are full of warm, spicy, and cozy flavor. Pepparkakor (or ""pepper cookies"") are Swedish cookies. Similar to gingersnaps, pepparkakor are thin, crisp, and spicy. They're commonly baked and sold in Scandinavian countries during the holiday season. These are the ingredients you'll need to make this traditional pepparkakor recipe:,· Flour: This pepparkakor recipe starts with all-purpose flour, which gives the cookies structure.
· Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
· Spices: These cozy pepparkakor cookies are spiced with cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom.
· Butter: Two sticks of butter add moisture and richness.
· Sugar: A blend of white and brown sugars gives these cookies a perfectly balanced sweet flavor.
· Egg: A beaten egg adds moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dough together.
· Corn syrup: Dark corn syrup adds even more moisture and sweetness. If you'd like a lighter flavor, opt for light corn syrup. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make pepparkakor cookies at home:,1. Make the dough: Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the butter and sugars, then add the remaining ingredients. Add the dry mix to the wet mix, then chill the dough.
2. Roll and cut the dough: Roll the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters.
3. Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Allow the cookies to cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store at room temperature for up to one week. Unbaked pepparkakor dough will freeze well for up to three months.

Traditionally, the drink is set on fire so the sugar granules completely dissolve.

It calls for a combination of port wine (don't throw away the bottles!), bourbon whiskey, and white rum.

· Sugar: Sweeten things up with ¾ cup white sugar.
· Raisins and almonds: Raisins and almonds lend subtle, yet welcome, flavor. Tip: Use an ordinary port wine for this recipe, because the strong-flavored spices and other ingredients will overwhelm an expensive wine. Making Swedish glögg for the first time can be intimidating, but it's actually not that hard (you just need a great recipe). You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,1. Heat the port wine. Add bourbon and rum, making sure the alcohol is warm but not simmering.
2. Secure the spices and orange peel strip in a cheesecloth square tied with twine.
3. Carefully light the alcohol with a long-handled match and let burn for one minute.
4. Place the lid on the pot to extinguish the flames. Let cool for 10 minutes.
5. Add the bundled spices and let cool to room temperature.
6. Strain and serve, garnishing with the reserved raisins and almonds.

You can also refrigerate the steeped raisins and almonds in a covered bowl or jar for up to a year. ""Just like what my grandfather used to make,"" says Write from the Heart. ""Warms the heart and the blue flames make a spectacular show that will break the ice at even the stiffest of gatherings. Sometimes I use rum instead of whiskey. Can adapt this to be non-alcoholic: one liter apple juice, one liter cranberry juice, one lemon sliced."",""I grew up in Sweden and still have family there and visit on a regular basis,"" according to mitoboru. ""I have had and made my fair share of glögg, including my grandmother's recipe. This is by far the best one to date."",""Growing up with a Swedish family, this was a staple of Christmas,"" says Erinammo. ""The smell is so sweet and wonderful. This is exactly how my father makes it. Be prepared though for the kick and don't expect to drink too much!"",Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,Heat port wine in a large stockpot with a lid over medium heat until just below the simmering point. Add bourbon and rum; heat until just below simmering. Save the bottles and their caps for storing leftover glögg. Meanwhile, place cinnamon stick, orange peel, cloves, and cardamom pods in the center of the cheesecloth square. Gather edges of the cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine to secure; set aside. When wine mixture is very hot but not boiling, carefully light it with a long-handled match. Wearing a heatproof cooking mitt, carefully pour sugar into the flames; let mixture burn for 1 minute. Place the lid on the stockpot to extinguish the flames and turn off the heat. Let mixture cool, covered, about 10 minutes. Add the cheesecloth spice bundle, raisins, and almonds to warm wine mixture; let it cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Strain cooled glögg and reserve the raisins and almonds. To serve: Pour glögg into a saucepan and warm over medium-low heat until hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes. Ladle 3 ounces of warmed glögg into a small coffee cup or a small Swedish-style glögg mug, and garnish each serving with a few reserved raisins and almonds. Use an ordinary port wine for this recipe, because the strong-flavored spices and other ingredients will overwhelm an expensive wine. Pour strained glögg into the reserved bottles, recap, and keep upright in a cool dark place for up to 1 year. Refrigerate the steeped raisins and almonds in a covered bowl or jar for up to 1 year."," bottleport wine, bottle proof bourbon whiskey, bottle white rum, cinnamon stick, strip of orange peel, whole cloves, whole cardamom pods, cracked, square of cheesecloth, white sugarpackage dark raisinspackage blanched slivered almonds",https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v/mm/image?url=httpsAFFimages.media-allrecipes.comFuserphotosF99.jpg&q=&c=sc&orient=true,"Glögg ia Swedish punch made from spiced wine.

Puerto Rican,Coquito,"Have the happiest holiday ever with this top-rated coquito recipe. Whether you bottle it and give it as gifts or keep the whole batch to yourself, this boozy drink will make your season extra festive. Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means ""little coconut."" The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as ""Puerto Rican eggnog."",These are the ingredients you'll need to make a decadent batch of coquito:,· Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.
· Eggs: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.
· Cream of coconut: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.
· Sweetened condensed milk: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!
· White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.
· Water: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.
· Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.
· Spices: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this crowd-pleasing coquito:,1. Cook the evaporated milk and egg yolks in a double boiler until thick.
2. Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend with the remaining ingredients.
3. Transfer to glass bottles and chill overnight. Stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator, coquito can last one to two months. Since the eggs may separate and settle, make sure to stir the drink before serving. ""I make this every Christmas, bottles and bottles of it,"" says Deana. ""I give it as gifts and make it for my family as well. This recipe is perfect, you won't be disappointed!"",""My husband and I absolutely love it,"" raves butterflybutt. ""The only thing I did differently was add coconut water instead of plain water and I also added a little nutmeg instead of cloves.

Norwegian,Kransekake ,"Impress everyone at your holiday party with this traditional kransekake. It's stunning, delicious, and easier to make than you might think. Kransekake is a traditional Danish and Norwegian dessert made of cookie-like cake rings that are layered in concentric rings to form a cone-shaped cake. The layers are ""glued"" together with sugary icing. Made with ground almonds, egg whites, and confectioners' sugar, kransekake has a light texture and nutty flavor that's impossible to resist. Here's what you'll need to make this homemade kransekake recipe:,· Confectioners' sugar: You'll need a little over six cups of confectioners for this kransekake recipe (4 ⅓ for the cake and two for the icing).
· Ground almonds: Both blanched (almonds with their skins removed) and unblanched ground almonds are necessary for this recipe.
· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.
· Egg whites: No yolks are needed for this light and airy kransekake recipe! Three egg whites go into the cake and one goes into the icing.
· Lemon juice: A teaspoon of lemon juice enhances the overall flavor of the icing and adds subtle brightness.
· Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract is another subtle flavor enhancer for the 4-ingredient icing. Tip: If you purchased whole almonds, it is easiest to grind them in a coffee grinder or specialized nut grinder. Once ground, sift them to make sure all big chunks are taken out, and regrind those chunks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this gorgeous kransekake:,1. Make the dough: Mix the dry ingredients, then stir in the egg whites. Knead the dough until it holds itself together.
2. Shape the dough: Roll the dough into 18 ropes of increasingly long lengths. Shape the ropes into rings.
3. Bake the dough: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until it's golden brown. Let them cool completely.
4. Make the icing: Whisk the egg white and gradually add the remaining icing ingredients. Pour it into a piping bag.
5. Assemble the cake: Use the icing to assemble the cake according to the detailed instructions below. Tip: If you have special kransekake molds, use those to shape and bake the dough.Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,The icing in this recipe contains raw egg. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and the infirm do not consume raw egg. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine confectioners' sugar, ground almonds, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in egg whites, one at a time, to form a firm dough. Knead dough for 2 minutes until it holds together and doesn't fall apart easily. Roll dough into 18 ropes the thickness of your index finger, each rope a little longer than the next. Shape each rope into a ring. Arrange rings on the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch smaller cookie rings carefully, as they may finish baking before the larger ones. Let cookies cool completely on baking sheets. To make the icing: Whisk egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually whisk in confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, until thickened; stir in lemon juice and vanilla extract. Pour icing into a piping bag fitted with a small tip. Pipe a thin ring of icing onto the base of the largest ring and adhere it to a serving plate. Pipe icing in a zig-zag pattern over the ring. Stack remaining cake rings on top, from largest to smallest, piping icing in a zig-zag pattern between each ring.

Jewish,Challah Bread,"Challah is an ancient Jewish bread that's had its share of internet fame (remember the rainbow everything fad? Or the mind-bending twelve-strand braided bread?). The basic blueprint has stayed the same: A rich, slightly sweet bread made with flour, eggs, oil, yeast, and honey. Whether you stick to the classic, top with poppy or sesame seeds, add golden raisins, shape it, stuff it, or swirl it, challah is one of the best (and easiest) breads to make at home. Read on to learn all about challah, from its symbolism in Judaism to how to braid, freeze, and use it (besides tearing big pieces right from the loaf). Challah bread is a white, leavened, braided bread with Ashkenazi Jewish origins. It's typically made with eggs, yeast, flour, honey (or sugar), and salt. Challah is a staple of every Jewish table on the sabbath — Friday evening to Saturday evening — and many Jewish holidays like Hanukkah and Yom Kippur (it's often the first food eaten to break the fast). Challah bread is also part of many important Jewish rituals, from weddings to funerals and nearly every occasion in between.The way the challah is braided or shaped also has its own meaning in Judaism. A three-stand brand symbolizes truth, peace, and justice. A braid with twelve ""humps"" represents the twelve tribes of Israel. Round or spiral-shaped challahs are eaten during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, as a symbol of the cycle of the seasons. Both types of bread have lots of eggs and are known for their richness. The big difference here is butter. In a brioche, lots and lots of butter is incorporated into the dough. Challah is made without butter so it can be pareve (PAR-reve), or kosher in a meal that includes meat (Jews who keep kosher don't mix meat and dairy in the same meal). You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make challah bread at home:,1. Activate the yeast.
2. Make the dough.
3. Turn out and knead the dough.
4. Let the dough rise.
5. Roll and braid the dough according to the below directions.
6. Let the dough rise again.
7. Add an egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds.
8. Bake the challah bread until golden brown. Once your dough has risen, divide into three equal pieces and gently roll into 11/2-inch-thick ropes with the palms of your hands (the ropes should be about the same length). Pinch the ropes together at one end and braid fairly tightly. Pinch the opposite ends together. Tuck the ends underneath the loaf. Place your challah in a resealable bag and press out all the air before sealing. Freeze for up to three months or leave on your counter to enjoy all week. The oil and the extra eggs in challah bread help it stay soft longer than other loaves. And when it starts to go stale, it's time for bread pudding or French toast!,Challah can absorb lots of liquid without falling apart, making it perfect for a custardy bread pudding, French toast, or even your Thanksgiving stuffing. Use challah in simple sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly is a fave) but skip it for sandwiches that need something sturdier, like a grilled cheese or a sandwich with lots of heavy fillings. ""This was a great easy to follow recipe,"" says reviewer jen. Delicious and quite true to Brooklyn bakery Challah bread!"". ""My first time making challah and this was so easy to follow. It turned out great! Very eggy and a little sweet, like a dense Hawaiian bread,"" user Vanessa Armand wrote.

Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half and knead each half for 5 minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep it from getting sticky. Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Pinch the ends of the three snakes together firmly and braid from middle. Either leave as a braid or form into a round braided loaf by bringing ends together, curving the braid into a circle, and pinching ends together. Grease two baking trays and place the finished braid or round on each. Cover with a towel and let rise for about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid; sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Greek,Greek Baklava,"Believe it or not, you can make Greek restaurant-worthy baklava in the comfort of your own kitchen — and it's actually not that hard! This top-rated baklava recipe, which is surprisingly approachable for beginner bakers, has racked up almost 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community. Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary syrup. Pronounce ""baklava"" like ""bah-klah-vah."" The stress is placed on the first syllable. Though baklava is often associated with Greek restaurants now, its exact origins are unclear. Food historians think modern baklava may have been invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire, then modified in Greece. However, the technique of layering unleavened bread with nuts and honey can be traced back as far as the 8th century B.C.E. during the Assyrian Empire. Here's what you need to make the best baklava of your life:,Phyllo Dough
Make your own phyllo pastry dough or buy frozen phyllo dough at the store. Nuts
Chopped walnuts, pistachios, or a mixture of both are traditionally used. Hazelnuts and/or pecans would also work. Butter
Not only does butter add richness and flavor, it keeps the phyllo sheets moist and soft. It also helps the sheets stay together. Cinnamon
Cinnamon is responsible for baklava's signature warmth. Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey
A sweet syrup — made from water, sugar, vanilla extract, and honey — is poured over the baked baklava layers, bringing the delicious dessert together. Even though making baklava can be a bit time-consuming, it's probably not as hard as you think. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect. Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer. Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp. Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving. Baklava is super sugary, so it has a relatively long shelf-life. It will last for about two weeks stored in an airtight container. Keep it in the pantry if you like your baklava crispy. If you like it chewy, opt for the fridge. Yes, you can definitely freeze baklava. Just let it cool completely, wrap it in a layer of storage wrap, and then a layer of aluminum foil. Follow with another layer of aluminum foil for added protection. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. When culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. Nicole McMom) tried this top-rated baklava recipe, she declared it the ""perfect make-ahead dessert."" Here are a few of the best tips and tricks she learned along the way:,· Chop the nuts in a food processor to save time.
· Ensure the phyllo sheets stay moist during the layering process by keeping the stack covered with a damp paper towel or cloth.
· Worried about tearing the dough when you brush it with butter? Don't be! If you're concerned, Nicole suggests spraying melted butter onto the phyllo dough between layers instead of brushing it.
· If the phyllo dough sticks to your hands while you work with it, place a bowl of water next to your prep station. Keeping your fingertips moist will prevent sticking.
· When it's time to eat, consider serving (and storing) the baklava pieces in cupcake liners to nip sticky fingers in the bud. ""Definitely use a spritzer bottle for the melted butter, it cuts down on the time,"" says Dionne Sharp Ukleja. "" It made the assembly easy and effortless!"",""My husband and I have tried making homemade baklava a couple of times, and this is by FAR the BEST recipe we have used,"" raves jlgarnet. ""We followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly!"",""This is an amazing recipe,"" raves cookingmom. ""I added more cinnamon, but other than that I don't think any changes need to be made! The result has the perfect crispness and flavor! Excellent recipe!"",Editorial contributions by Corey Williams,Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan. Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp. Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.

It's impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think. A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked. Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. ""Cordon bleu"" translates to ""blue ribbon."" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs. There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:,Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Chicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.

"Cajun, Creole",Cajun Spice Mix,"Cajun spice mix is a Louisiana seasoning that packs a punch when it comes to flavors. The delicious (and mildly spicy) seasoning lends itself to so many wonderful dishes — like pastas, shrimp, chicken, fish, and much, much more. If you've never made your own Cajun spice mix at home, just know that not only are you missing out on great flavors — you're also missing out on savings. That's right, homemade Cajun seasoning tastes better and it's cheaper than store-bought! Do you need any more reasons to try this recipe?,Cajun seasoning hails from Louisiana, which is home to Cajun cuisine. The cuisine is a wonderful blend of Native American, West African, Caribbean, and French cooking styles. Cajun seasoning is a blend of spices that create a spicy, earthy, and sometimes smoky flavor. Typical Cajun seasonings (including store-bought like Slap Ya Mama and Tony Chachere's) are made with black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. For different flavors, some Cajun spice mixes include salt, mustard powder, chile peppers, or cumin. This spice mix also includes oregano and thyme, which you don't normally see in Cajun spice mixes — those are typically found in Creole spice mixes. Creole cuisine, which also originated in Louisiana, is a mixture of African, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish cooking styles. So, Creole seasoning typically has more herbs than Cajun seasoning. Creole seasoning is made with black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, thyme, basil, and oregano. Sometimes, you might find bay leaves, rosemary, or parsley in it too. So, Creole seasoning has a light spicy kick, but it has more aromatics to balance it out than Cajun seasoning does. Learn more: What's the Difference Between Cajun and Creole?,Blackened seasoning can be described as a mixture between Cajun seasoning and Creole seasoning. It's quite spicy (from the cayenne or chili powder), but it also contains aromatic herbs (like oregano, thyme, and basil). Blackened seasoning is also different from Cajun seasoning in the way it's used. The term ""blackened"" doesn't really have anything to do with the seasoning itself, but in the way the food is prepared. The protein, like fish, shrimp, or chicken, is drenched in butter, then heavily coated in blackened seasoning and seared. The blackened seasoning will create a blackened crust on the outside of the food after a few minutes of cooking. Making homemade spice mixes is so easy, there's really no excuse not to do it! Simply stir all the ingredients together in a bowl until well combined, then store in an airtight container or jar. Cajun seasoning is great on protein, like chicken, fish, shrimp, and steak, but it's also delicious in pasta dishes, rice, and stuffed peppers.
